abstract: 'Being able to customize sewing patterns for different human bodies without
  using any pre-defined adjustment rule will not only improve the realism of virtual
  humans in the entertainment industry, but also deeply affect the fashion industry
  by making fast fashion and made-to-measure garments more accessible. To meet the
  requirement set by the fashion industry, a sewing pattern adjustment system must
  be both efficient and precise, which unfortunately cannot be achieved by existing
  techniques. In this paper, we propose to solve sewing pattern adjustment as a nonlinear
  optimization problem immediately, rather than in two phases: a garment shape optimization
  phase and an inverse pattern design phase as in previous systems. This allows us
  to directly minimize the objective function that evaluates the fitting quality of
  the garment sewn from a pattern, without any compromise caused by the nonexistence
  of the solution to inverse pattern design. To improve the efficiency of our system,
  we carry out systematic research on a variety of optimization topics, including
  pattern parametrization, initialization, an inexact strategy, acceleration, and
  CPU-GPU implementation. We verify the usability of our system through automatic
  grading tests and made-to-measure tests. Designers and pattern makers confirm that
  our pattern results are able to preserve design details and their fitting qualities
  are acceptable. In our computational experiment, the system further demonstrates
  its efficiency, reliability, and flexibility of handling various pattern designs.
  While our current system still needs to overcome certain limitations, we believe
  it is a crucial step toward fully automatic pattern design and adjustment in the
  future.'
summary: 'We propose to solve sewing pattern adjustment as a nonlinear
  optimization problem immediately, so as to minimize the objective function
  that evaluates the fitting quality of the garment sewn from a pattern.'
