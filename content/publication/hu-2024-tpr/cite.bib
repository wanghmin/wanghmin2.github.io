 abstract = {Modeling and producing lifelike clothed human images has attracted researchers’
attention from different areas for decades, with the complexity from highly articulated
and structured content. Rendering algorithms decompose and simulate the
imaging process of a camera, while are limited by the accuracy of modeled variables
and the efficiency of computation. Generative models can produce impressively
vivid human images, however still lacking in controllability and editability. This
paper studies photorealism enhancement of rendered images, leveraging generative
power from diffusion models on the controlled basis of rendering. We introduce
a novel framework to translate rendered images into their realistic counterparts,
which consists of two stages: Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI) and Realistic
Image Generation (RIG). In DKI, we adopt positive (real) domain finetuning
and negative (rendered) domain embedding to inject knowledge into a pretrained
Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. In RIG, we generate the realistic image corresponding
to the input rendered image, with a Texture-preserving Attention Control
(TAC) to preserve fine-grained clothing textures, exploiting the decoupled features
encoded in the UNet structure. Additionally, we introduce SynFashion dataset,
featuring high-quality digital clothing images with diverse textures. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method
in rendered-to-real image translation.},
