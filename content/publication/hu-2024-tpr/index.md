abstract: Modeling and producing lifelike clothed human images has attracted researchersâ€™
  attention from different areas for decades, with the complexity from highly articulated
  and structured content. Rendering algorithms decompose and simulate the
  imaging process of a camera, while are limited by the accuracy of modeled variables
  and the efficiency of computation. Generative models can produce impressively
  vivid human images, however still lacking in controllability and editability. This
  paper studies photorealism enhancement of rendered images, leveraging generative
  power from diffusion models on the controlled basis of rendering. We introduce
  a novel framework to translate rendered images into their realistic counterparts,
  which consists of two stages: Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI) and Realistic
  Image Generation (RIG). In DKI, we adopt positive (real) domain finetuning
  and negative (rendered) domain embedding to inject knowledge into a pretrained
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. In RIG, we generate the realistic image corresponding
  to the input rendered image, with a Texture-preserving Attention Control
  (TAC) to preserve fine-grained clothing textures, exploiting the decoupled features
  encoded in the UNet structure. Additionally, we introduce SynFashion dataset,
  featuring high-quality digital clothing images with diverse textures. Extensive
  experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method
  in rendered-to-real image translation.
summary: We introduce a novel diffusion-based framework that effectively translates rendered
  images into realistic counterparts, ensuring the preservation of texture details.
