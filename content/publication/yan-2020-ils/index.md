abstract: Splashing is one of the most fascinating liquid phenomena in the real world
  and it is favored by artists to create stunning visual effects, both statically
  and dynamically. Unfortunately, the generation of complex and specialized liquid
  splashes is a challenging task and often requires considerable time and effort.
  In this paper, we present a novel system that synthesizes realistic liquid splashes
  from simple user sketch input. Our system adopts a conditional generative adversarial
  network (cGAN) trained with physics-based simulation data to produce raw liquid
  splash models from input sketches, and then applies model refinement processes to
  further improve their small-scale details. The system considers not only the trajectory
  of every user stroke, but also its speed, which makes the splash model simulation-ready
  with its underlying 3D flow. Compared with simulation-based modeling techniques
  through trials and errors, our system offers flexibility, convenience and intuition
  in liquid splash design and editing. We evaluate the usability and the efficiency
  of our system in an immersive virtual reality environment. Thanks to this system,
  an amateur user can now generate a variety of realistic liquid splashes in just
  a few minutes.
summary: We present a novel system that synthesizes liquid splashes
  from user sketch input. Our system adopts cGAN to produce raw liquid splash models
  from input sketches, and applies model refinement to improve small-scale details.
