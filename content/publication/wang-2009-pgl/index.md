abstract: We present an image-based reconstruction framework to model real water scenes
  captured by stereoscopic video. In contrast to many image-based modeling techniques
  that rely on user interaction to obtain high-quality 3D models, we instead apply
  automatically calculated physically-based constraints to refine the initial model.
  The combination of image-based reconstruction with physically-based simulation allows
  us to model complex and dynamic objects such as fluid. Using a depth map sequence
  as initial conditions, we use a physically based approach that automatically fills
  in missing regions, removes outliers, and refines the geometric shape so that the
  final 3D model is consistent to both the input video data and the laws of physics.
  Physically-guided modeling also makes interpolation or extrapolation in the space-time
  domain possible, and even allows the fusion of depth maps that were taken at different
  times or viewpoints. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework with a number
  of real scenes, all captured using only a single pair of cameras.
