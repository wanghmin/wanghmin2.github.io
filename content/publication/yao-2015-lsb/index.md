abstract: 'As the 3D printing technology starts to revolutionize our daily life and
  the manufacturing industries, a critical problem is about to e-merge: how can we
  find an automatic way to divide a 3D model into multiple printable pieces, so as
  to save the space, to reduce the printing time, or to make a large model printable
  by small printers. In this paper, we present a systematic study on the partitioning
  and packing of 3D models under the multi-phase level set framework. We first construct
  analysis tools to evaluate the qualities of a partitioning using six metrics: stress
  load, surface details, interface area, packed size, printability, and assembling.
  Based on this analysis, we then formulate level set methods to improve the qualities
  of the partitioning according to the metrics. These methods are integrated into
  an automatic system, which repetitively and locally optimizes the partitioning.
  Given the optimized partitioning result, we further provide a container structure
  modeling algorithm to facilitate the packing process of the printed pieces. Our
  experiment shows that the system can generate quality partitioning of various 3D
  models for space saving and fast production purposes.'
summary: 'In this paper, we present a systematic study on the partitioning
  and packing of 3D models under the multi-phase level set framework.'
