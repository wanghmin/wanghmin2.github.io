abstract: The simulation of fluid mixing under the Eulerian framework often suffers
  from numerical dissipation issues. In this paper, we present a mass-preserving convection
  scheme that offers direct control on the shape of the interface. The key component
  of this scheme is a sharpening term built upon the diffusive flux of a user-specified
  kernel function. To determine the thickness of the ideal interface during fluid
  mixing, we perform theoretical analysis on a one-dimensional diffusive model using
  the Fick's law of diffusion. By explicitly controlling the interface thickness using
  a spatio-temporally varying kernel variable, we can use our scheme to produce realistic
  fluid mixing effects without numerical dissipation artifacts. We can also use the
  scheme to control interface changes between two fluids, due to temperature, pressure,
  or external energy input. This convection scheme is compatible with many advection
  methods and it has a small computational overhead.
summary: The simulation of fluid mixing under the Eulerian framework often suffers
  from numerical dissipation issues. We present a mass-preserving convection
  scheme that offers direct control on the shape of the interface.
