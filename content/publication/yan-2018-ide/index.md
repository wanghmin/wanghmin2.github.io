abstract: 'Elastic parameter optimization has revealed its importance in 3D modeling,
  virtual reality, and additive manufacturing in recent years. Unfortunately, it is
  known to be computationally expensive, especially if there are many parameters and
  data samples. To address this challenge, we propose to introduce the inexactness
  into descent methods, by iteratively solving a forward simulation step and a parameter
  update step in an inexact manner. The development of such inexact descent methods
  is centered at two questions: 1) how accurate/inaccurate can the two steps be; and
  2) what is the optimal way to implement an inexact descent method. The answers to
  these questions are in our convergence analysis, which proves the existence of relative
  error thresholds for the two inexact steps to ensure the convergence. This means
  we can simply solve each step by a fixed number of iterations, if the iterative
  solver is at least linearly convergent. While the use of the inexact idea speeds
  up many descent methods, we specifically favor a GPU-based one powered by state-of-the-art
  simulation techniques. Based on this method, we study a variety of implementation
  issues, including backtracking line search, initialization, regularization, and
  multiple data samples. We demonstrate the use of our inexact method in elasticity
  measurement and design applications. Our experiment shows the method is fast, reliable,
  memory-efficient, GPU-friendly, flexible with different elastic models, scalable
  to a large parameter space, and parallelizable for multiple data samples.'
