abstract: 'In recent years, various methods have been introduced to exploit pre-recorded
  data to improve the performance and/or realism of dynamic deformations, but their
  differences and similarities have not been adequately analyzed or discussed. So
  far, the proposed methods have been explored mainly in the research context. They
  have not been adopted by the computer graphics industry.This course bridges the
  gap between research labs and industry to present a unifying theory and understanding
  of data-driven methods for dynamic deformations that may inspire development of
  novel solutions. It focuses on application of data-driven methods to three areas
  of computer animation: dynamic deformation of faces, soft volumetric tissue, and
  cloth. And it describes how to approach these challenges in a data-driven manner,
  classifies the various methods, and demonstrates how data-driven methods can work
  in other settings.'
