abstract: Physics-based animation of elastic materials allows to simulate dynamic
  deformable objects such as fabrics, human tissue, hair, etc. Due to their complex
  inner mechanical behaviour, it is difficult to replicate their motions interactively
  and accurately at the same time. This course introduces students and practitioners
  to several parallel iterative techniques to tackle this problem and achieve elastic
  deformations in real-time. We focus on techniques for applications such as video
  games and interactive design, with fixed and small hard time budgets available for
  physically-based animation, and where responsiveness and stability are often more
  important than accuracy, as long as the results are believable. The course focuses
  on solvers able to fully exploit the computational capabilities of modern GPU architectures,
  effectively solving systems of hundreds of thousands of nonlinear equations in a
  matter of few milliseconds. The course introduces the basic concepts concerning
  physics-based elastic objects, and provide an overview of the different types of
  numerical solvers available in the literature. Then, we show how some variants of
  traditional solvers can address real-time animation and assess them in terms of
  accuracy, robustness and performance. Practical examples are provided throughout
  the course, in particular how to apply the depicted solvers to Projective Dynamics
  and Position-based Dynamics, two recent and popular physics models for elastic materials.
