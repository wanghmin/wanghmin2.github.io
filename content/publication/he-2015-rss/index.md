abstract: 'Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is efficient, mass preserving, and
  flexible in handling topological changes. However, sparsely sampled thin features
  are difficult to simulate in SPH-based free surface flows, due to a number of robustness
  and stability issues. In this article, we address this problem from two perspectives:
  the robustness of surface forces and the numerical instability of thin features.
  We present a new surface tension force scheme based on a free surface energy functional,
  under the diffuse interface model. We develop an efficient way to calculate the
  air pressure force for free surface flows, without using air particles. Compared
  with previous surface force formulae, our formulae are more robust against particle
  sparsity in thin feature cases. To avoid numerical instability on thin features,
  we propose to adjust the internal pressure force by estimating the internal pressure
  at two scales and filtering the force using a geometry-aware anisotropic kernel.
  Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms in handling a variety
  of sparsely sampled thin liquid features, including thin sheets, thin jets, and
  water splashes.'
