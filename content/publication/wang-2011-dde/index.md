abstract: Cloth often has complicated nonlinear, anisotropic elastic behavior due
  to its woven pattern and fiber properties. However, most current cloth simulation
  techniques simply use linear and isotropic elastic models with manually selected
  stiffness parameters. Such simple simulations do not allow differentiating the behavior
  of distinct cloth materials such as silk or denim, and they cannot model most materials
  with fidelity to their real-world counterparts. In this paper, we present a data-driven
  technique to more realistically animate cloth. We propose a piecewise linear elastic
  model that is a good approximation to nonlinear, anisotropic stretching and bending
  behaviors of various materials. We develop new measurement techniques for studying
  the elastic deformations for both stretching and bending in real cloth samples.
  Our setup is easy and inexpensive to construct, and the parameters of our model
  can be fit to observed data with a well-posed optimization procedure. We have measured
  a database of ten different cloth materials, each of which exhibits distinctive
  elastic behaviors. These measurements can be used in most cloth simulation systems
  to create natural and realistic clothing wrinkles and shapes, for a range of different
  materials.
