abstract: As 3D content becomes increasingly prevalent, thereâ€™s a growing focus on
  the development of engagements with 3D virtual content. Unfortunately, traditional
  techniques for creating, editing, and interacting with this content are fraught
  with difficulties. They tend to be not only engineering-intensive but also require
  extensive expertise, which adds to the frustration and inefficiency in virtual object
  manipulation. Our proposed VR-GS system represents a leap forward in human-centered
  3D content interaction, offering a seamless and intuitive user experience. By developing
  a physical dynamics-aware interactive Gaussian Splatting (GS) in a Virtual Reality
  (VR) setting, and constructing a highly efficient two-level embedding strategy alongside
  deformable body simulations, VR-GS ensures real-time execution with highly realistic
  dynamic responses. The components of our system are designed for high efficiency
  and effectiveness, starting from detailed scene reconstruction and object segmentation,
  advancing through multi-view image in-painting, and extending to interactive physics-based
  editing. The system also incorporates real-time deformation embedding and dynamic
  shadow casting, ensuring a comprehensive and engaging virtual experience.
