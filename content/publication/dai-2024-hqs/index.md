abstract: We propose a novel point-based representation, Gaussian surfels, to combine
  the advantages of the flexible optimization procedure in 3D Gaussian points and
  the surface alignment property of surfels. This is achieved by directly setting
  the z-scale of 3D Gaussian points to 0, effectively flattening the original 3D ellipsoid
  into a 2D ellipse. Such a design provides clear guidance to the optimizer. By treating
  the local z-axis as the normal direction, it greatly improves optimization stability
  and surface alignment. While the derivatives to the local z-axis computed from the
  covariance matrix are zero in this setting, we design a self-supervised normal-depth
  consistency loss to remedy this issue. Monocular normal priors and foreground masks
  are incorporated to enhance the quality of the reconstruction, mitigating issues
  related to highlights and background. We propose a volumetric cutting method to
  aggregate the information of Gaussian surfels so as to remove erroneous points in
  depth maps generated by alpha blending. Finally, we apply screened Poisson reconstruction
  method to the fused depth maps to extract the surface mesh. Experimental results
  show that our method demonstrates superior performance in surface reconstruction
  compared to state-of-the-art neural volume rendering and point-based rendering methods.
